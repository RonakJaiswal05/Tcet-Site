    <h1>Animation and Design.</h1>
    <h5>A course in Animation and Design is a comprehensive educational program that covers various aspects of
        animation, graphic design, and visual storytelling. Here's a detailed explanation of what such a course
        typically entails:</h5>
        <div class="rev">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Introduction to Animation:</h3>The course usually begins with an introduction to the fundamentals of
                    animation. Students learn about key animation principles such as timing, spacing, squash and stretch,
                    anticipation, and follow-through. They also explore different animation techniques including traditional
                    hand-drawn animation, 3D animation, stop-motion, and computer-generated imagery (CGI).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Character Animation:</h3> A significant portion of the course focuses on character animation. Students
                    learn how to create believable and expressive characters, develop character designs, rigging, and animate
                    them to convey emotions, movement, and personality. They explore topics such as walk cycles, facial
                    expressions, lip-syncing, and character acting.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Storyboarding and Storytelling:</h3>Storytelling is a crucial aspect of animation. Students learn how to
                    develop compelling narratives, create storyboards, and visualize scenes. They understand the importance of
                    pacing, composition, camera angles, and continuity in conveying a story effectively through animation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Graphic Design Principles: </h3>In addition to animation, the course covers graphic design principles
                    and techniques. Students learn about typography, color theory, layout design, composition, and visual
                    hierarchy. They acquire skills in using graphic design software such as Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and
                    InDesign to create logos, posters, advertisements, and other visual assets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Motion Graphics and Visual Effects:</h3>Students explore the field of motion graphics and visual effects
                    (VFX), which involves creating animated graphics and effects for film, television, video games, and digital
                    media. They learn how to use software tools such as Adobe After Effects, Cinema 4D, and Maya to design and
                    animate motion graphics, special effects, and compositing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Digital Art and Illustration: </h3>The course often includes modules on digital art and illustration.
                    Students learn digital painting techniques, vector illustration, and digital sculpting using software like
                    Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Procreate. They develop skills in creating digital artwork, concept art,
                    and visual assets for animation and design projects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Interactive Design and User Experience (UX): </h3>Some courses may include aspects of interactive design
                    and user experience (UX) design. Students learn how to design user interfaces (UI), interactive prototypes,
                    and user experiences for websites, mobile apps, and interactive media. They understand principles of
                    usability, accessibility, and user-centered design.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Industry Software and Tools:</h3>Throughout the course, students gain proficiency in industry-standard
                    software and tools used in animation and design. This may include animation software like Adobe Animate,
                    Toon Boom Harmony, and Autodesk Maya, as well as graphic design software, video editing tools, and 3D
                    modeling software.
                </li>
